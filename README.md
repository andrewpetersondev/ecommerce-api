This node application is an api for an ecommerce store. The deployed app is supposed to display the input and output of each controller method.

The main problem with this application is that I was not able to get Postman to export all of the user data. This happens because the app distinguishes between "users" and "admins". Therefore, whenever I logout in Postman, the data is deleted from the session state. That is why only some of the links appear to work. It is important to note that the application works perfectly.

The way to fix this is to manually manipulate the exported data from Postman. I did not do this because that would be very cumbersome and I want to get on to the next project.
